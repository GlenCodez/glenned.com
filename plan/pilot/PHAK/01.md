# Chapter 01: Introduction to Flying

- Ultralight Vehicles
  - Powered must weigh less than 254 pounds empty
  - Unpowered must weight less than 155 pounds
- Aircraft Classifications:
  - Airplane: Engine driven, fixed-wing, heavier than air
  - Glider: Same as airplane but not engine driven
  - Lighter-than-air: Rises and remains suspended using gas weighing less than air displaced.
    - Airship: Engine driven, can be steered
    - Balloon: Not engine driven, sustains flight through gas buoyancy or airborne heater
  - Powered-lift: Heavier-than-air, vertical takeoff, vertical landing, nonrotating airfoil(s) for lift during horizontal flight
  - Powered Parachute (PPC): Flexible or semi-rigid wing connected to a fuselage. Said wing not in position for flight until aircraft is in motion. Fuselage contains aircraft engine, seat for occupant(s) and is attached to landing gear
  - Rocket: Propelled by ejected expanding gases generated in the engine from self-contained propellants. Not dependent on intake of outside substances
  - Rotorcraft: Heavier-than-air, lift generated by one or more rotors.
    - Gyroplane: Rotors are not engine driven except for initial starting. Made to rotate by action of air when rotorcraft is moving. Means of propulsion is independent of the rotor system
    - Helicopter: Horizontal motion depends on engine-driven rotors.
  - Weight-Shift-Control: Powered aircraft, framed pivoting wing, fuselage controllable in pitch and roll by changing center of gravity with respect to wing.  Flight controll of aircraft depends on wings ability to flexibly deform
- Size & Weight Groupings of Aircraft:
  - Large: More than 12,500 pounds, maximum certificated takeoff weight.
  - Lighg-sport (LSA): Aircraft, other than helicopter or powered-lift, that since original certification continues to meet definition in 14 CFR 1.1.
    - Maximum takeoff weight not more than:
      - 1320 pounds (600 kilograms) for non-water
      - 1430 pounds (650 kilograms) for water
    - Max airspeed in level flight with max continuous power of not more than 120 knots CAS under standard atomospheric conditions at sea level
    - Max seating of no more than 2 persions, including pilot
    - Single, reciprocating engine
    - Fixed or ground-adjustable propeller if powered aircraft other than powered glider
    - Nonpressurized cabin, if equipped with cabin
    - Max airspeed 120 knots
    - Fixed landing gear, except for water or glider
    - fixed or repositionable landing gear, or hull, for water aircraft
    - Max stall speed or min steady flight speed without use of lift-enhancing devices of not more than 45 knots CAS at aircrafts max certificated takeoff weight and most critical COG
  - Small: 12,500 pounds or less max certificated takeoff weight
- Pilot Certifications
  - Privileges:
    - Where & when pilot may fly
    - Whom they may fly with
    - Purpose of flight
    - Type of aircraft allowed to fly
  - Limitations: FAA may impose limitations on pilot certificate if during training or practical test pilot does not demonstrate all skills necessary to exercise all privileges of certain level, category, class, or type rating
- Endorsements are written and signed by an authorized individual, usually Certificated Flight Instructor (CFI) and based on aircraft classification
